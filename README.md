# Cleric-Clashers-SRC
 Source code repository for the turn-based RPG college project.

All artwork and music tracks were sourced from the games Darkest Dungeon 1 and 2, trademarks of Red Hook Studios. Character sprites were traced from these art assets with some modifications to better suit the game's visuals.

All sound effects were sourced from freesound.org.

All programming was done from scratch, and was the primary emphasis of this project as practice for future projects and endeavors.
