 Source code repository for the turn-based RPG college project.

All artwork and music tracks were sourced from the game Darkest Dungeon, a trademark of Red Hook Studios. Character sprites were traced from these art assets with some modifications to better suit the game's visuals.

All sound effects were sourced from freesound.org.

Otherwise all assets and code are 100% original and produced from scratch, in particular with the code of the battle system.
